**Added:**

* <news item>

**Changed:**

* Structural analysis data is no longer written to `structural_analysis.json`
  but rather a 32bit numpy compressed file named `structural_analysis.npz`
  (PR #937).
* Structural analysis array data is no longer directly returned in the
  RelativeHybridTopologyProtocol result dictionary. Instead it should
  be accessed from the serialized NPZ file `structural_analysis.npz`.
  The `structural_analysis` key now contains a path to the NPZ file,
  if the structural analysis did not fail (the `structural_analysis_error`
  key will instead be present on failure) (PR #937).

**Deprecated:**
