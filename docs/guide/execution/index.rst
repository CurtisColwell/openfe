Execution
=========

Once you've set up a :ref:`Alchemical Network<alchemical_network_model>`, the next step is to execute the simulations defined by each of the ``Transformations`` that make up the edges of the ``Alchemical Network``.

The easiest way to execute a ``Transformation`` is by using the :ref:`quickrun CLI tool <userguide_quickrun>`.

For more advanced options, see the :ref:`theory of the execution model<userguide_execution_theory>` and :ref:`the Python API<reference_execution>`.
