Cookbook
========

This section describes common tasks involving the OpenFE Python API.

The :any:`OpenFE CLI<cli-reference>` provides a simple way to perform the most common procedures for free energy calculations, but does not provide much flexibility for fine-tuning your approach or combining OpenFE with other tools. The :any:`Python API<api>` allows that flexibility, but using it is more complex. This cookbook breaks down common steps that would be implemented in Python to help navigate that complexity.
